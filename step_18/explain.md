# FastAPI Form Models

## Introduction

In FastAPI, Form Models allow you to group multiple form fields using Pydantic models, which makes handling complex form data easier. By combining the `Form` class with a Pydantic model, you can define all the expected fields in a single model. This approach is particularly helpful for APIs that receive multiple form fields, like registration or feedback forms.

## Setting Up Form Models

To use a Form Model in FastAPI:

1. Define a **Pydantic model** with fields that represent the form data.
2. Create an endpoint that uses this model as a dependency.
