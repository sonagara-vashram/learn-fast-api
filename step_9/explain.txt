 - Body - Fields :-

        In FastAPI, **Body - Fields** refers to the ability to define individual fields within the request body when creating API endpoints. This functionality allows developers to specify the exact structure and data types expected in the incoming request, ensuring proper validation and adherence to the defined schema. By using the `Body()` function, developers can declare multiple fields with their respective types and constraints, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the API. Each field can have attributes such as `title`, `description`, `default`, and `example`, which provide additional context and documentation for users interacting with the API. For instance, when designing an endpoint to receive user registration data, developers can define fields for `username`, `email`, and `password`, each with specific validation criteria (like required fields or string length limits). This approach not only ensures that incoming data is correctly formatted but also automatically generates informative API documentation that describes each field's purpose and requirements. Overall, utilizing Body - Fields in FastAPI enhances the robustness of APIs by promoting strict data validation and improving user experience through clear documentation.
