 - Path Parameters and Numeric Validations :-

        In FastAPI, path parameters are integral components of the API endpoints, allowing for the dynamic retrieval of resources by including variable segments within the URL. For instance, an endpoint defined as `/items/{item_id}` uses `{item_id}` as a path parameter, which can represent any integer value associated with a specific item. FastAPI enhances the functionality of path parameters by allowing developers to impose numeric validations directly within the endpoint definition. By specifying types, such as `int` or `float`, for path parameters, FastAPI ensures that incoming requests are validated against the expected numeric types. If a request is made with an invalid type—like a string instead of an integer—FastAPI will automatically return a clear error response with a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code. Additionally, developers can further refine numeric parameters by implementing constraints such as minimum or maximum values, ensuring that only valid numbers are accepted. This feature of combining path parameters with numeric validations not only enhances data integrity and error handling but also provides a clear structure for building robust APIs that are easy to use and maintain.

 - Path :-

        In FastAPI, the `Path` function, imported from the `fastapi` module, is a powerful tool used to define and validate path parameters in API endpoints. Unlike standard path parameters that simply capture values from the URL, `Path` allows developers to add additional metadata and constraints to these parameters, such as minimum and maximum values, descriptions, and regular expressions for validation. For example, when defining an endpoint like `/items/{item_id}`, using `item_id: int = Path(..., ge=1)` would ensure that the parameter is not only an integer but also greater than or equal to 1. This functionality enhances the robustness of APIs by providing clear validation rules and automatically generating detailed error messages when constraints are violated. Furthermore, by integrating `Path` with FastAPI's automatic documentation generation, developers can produce well-documented APIs that clearly communicate the expected structure and constraints of path parameters to users. Overall, the `Path` function enriches the API development process by facilitating better data integrity and user-friendly error handling.
