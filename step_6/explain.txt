 - Path Parameters and Numeric Validations :-

        In FastAPI, path parameters are integral components of the API endpoints, allowing for the dynamic retrieval of resources by including variable segments within the URL. For instance, an endpoint defined as `/items/{item_id}` uses `{item_id}` as a path parameter, which can represent any integer value associated with a specific item. FastAPI enhances the functionality of path parameters by allowing developers to impose numeric validations directly within the endpoint definition. By specifying types, such as `int` or `float`, for path parameters, FastAPI ensures that incoming requests are validated against the expected numeric types. If a request is made with an invalid type—like a string instead of an integer—FastAPI will automatically return a clear error response with a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code. Additionally, developers can further refine numeric parameters by implementing constraints such as minimum or maximum values, ensuring that only valid numbers are accepted. This feature of combining path parameters with numeric validations not only enhances data integrity and error handling but also provides a clear structure for building robust APIs that are easy to use and maintain.

 - Path :-

        In FastAPI, a **path** refers to the URL structure that defines how clients can access various resources or endpoints of an API. Path parameters are dynamic segments within the URL that allow developers to capture values from the URL and use them in API logic. For example, in an endpoint defined as `/users/{user_id}`, the `{user_id}` portion is a path parameter that can represent different user identifiers. FastAPI automatically extracts this parameter from the incoming request and makes it available to the endpoint's function as a variable. This capability is essential for creating RESTful APIs where resources are often identified by unique identifiers in the URL. Additionally, path parameters can be combined with type annotations, allowing for automatic data validation and error handling, ensuring that the provided values meet expected criteria. By utilizing path parameters effectively, developers can create clean, intuitive, and easily navigable APIs that enhance the overall user experience.
