 - What is FastAPI?

    FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework designed to build APIs quickly and easily using Python. It is known for being highly efficient, making use of asynchronous programming, which allows it to handle multiple requests at once without slowing down.

 - Key Features:
    
    High Performance:

        FastAPI is one of the fastest web frameworks available, thanks to its asynchronous support. It is built using Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation, both of which are highly optimized.

    Ease of Use:

        If you are familiar with Python, learning FastAPI is very simple because it is designed to be Pythonic. It uses Python’s type hints for data validation, making it easy to ensure the correctness of API requests.

    Automatic Documentation:

        One of FastAPI’s standout features is automatic generation of interactive documentation using Swagger UI and ReDoc. These tools allow developers to easily test and document APIs without extra effort.
    
    Asynchronous and Synchronous Support:

        FastAPI supports both synchronous and asynchronous code, making it ideal for building real-time applications like chat apps, live notifications, or any app that requires concurrent processes.

    Data Validation:

        Using Python's type hints, FastAPI automatically validates incoming data and sends appropriate error messages if the data is invalid. This ensures that the API can handle incorrect input gracefully.
        
    Great for Machine Learning & Data Science:

        FastAPI is highly suitable for data-heavy applications, such as deploying machine learning models or handling large datasets. Its speed and efficiency make it an excellent choice for APIs dealing with heavy computations.
