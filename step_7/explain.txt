 - Query Parameter Models :-

        In FastAPI, **Query Parameter Models** allow developers to define and validate query parameters in a structured way using Pydantic models. This feature enhances code organization and readability by enabling the encapsulation of multiple query parameters within a single model class. By creating a Pydantic model specifically for query parameters, developers can specify data types, default values, and additional validation rules, such as minimum and maximum lengths or regular expressions. For instance, a model can be defined to represent filters for a product search, including parameters like `category`, `price_range`, and `sort_order`. When the API endpoint receives a request, FastAPI automatically parses and validates the incoming query parameters against the defined model. If the provided parameters do not conform to the expected types or constraints, FastAPI returns clear error messages, ensuring robust error handling. This approach not only simplifies the management of complex query parameters but also improves the overall user experience by providing well-defined expectations for API consumers.

 - Depends :-

        In FastAPI, the `Depends` feature is a powerful mechanism used for dependency injection, allowing developers to declare and manage dependencies for their API endpoints seamlessly. This feature enables the reuse of logic and promotes cleaner, more maintainable code by separating concerns and encapsulating shared functionality in reusable components. When an endpoint requires a dependency, such as authentication, data retrieval, or specific business logic, developers can define it as a function that accepts parameters and is decorated with `Depends`. FastAPI then automatically resolves these dependencies, calling the required functions before executing the endpoint logic. For instance, if an endpoint needs to verify user credentials, a dependency function can handle this validation, and the result can be passed directly to the endpoint. This not only simplifies the code within the endpoint itself but also enhances testability and reusability of the logic across different endpoints. Overall, the `Depends` feature in FastAPI streamlines the development process, allowing for more organized and efficient code management while ensuring that complex dependencies are handled cleanly and effectively.
