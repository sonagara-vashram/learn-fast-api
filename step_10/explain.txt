 - Body - Nested Models :-

        In FastAPI, **Body - Nested Models** refers to the ability to use Pydantic models within other models, allowing for more complex and structured data in the request body. This is useful when you need to represent relationships between different types of data or group related fields together. For example, when dealing with user information and address details, the `User` model might contain an `Address` model as a nested field. This helps in organizing the data more cleanly and promotes better validation, as each nested model can have its own validation rules. FastAPI automatically handles the parsing and validation of these nested models, making sure that the entire structure conforms to the expected schema. Nested models not only improve code readability and maintainability but also enhance the auto-generated documentation, making it easier for developers to understand the expected data format. By nesting models, you can easily manage complex JSON structures in API requests while ensuring data consistency and validation.
