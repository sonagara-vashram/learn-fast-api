 - Query Parameters and String Validations :-

        In FastAPI, query parameters are a way to pass additional data to an API endpoint via the URL, typically following a question mark (?). These parameters can be used to filter, sort, or paginate data returned by an endpoint. FastAPI makes it easy to define query parameters by simply including them as function arguments in the route handler. Furthermore, FastAPI allows for robust string validation on these query parameters, enabling developers to impose constraints on the values received. For instance, you can specify minimum and maximum lengths for strings, enforce regex patterns, or even define choices using the `Enum` class. This validation occurs automatically when a request is made, ensuring that invalid data is rejected before processing. If a query parameter does not meet the specified validation criteria, FastAPI responds with a clear error message and a 422 Unprocessable Entity status code, helping developers quickly identify and rectify issues. Overall, the integration of query parameters and string validations enhances the functionality and reliability of APIs, making them more user-friendly and reducing the likelihood of errors due to improper input.

 - typing and Optional :-

        In FastAPI, typing is an essential feature that allows developers to specify the data types of function parameters and return values explicitly. This practice enhances code clarity, improves development speed, and enables automatic data validation and serialization. By using standard Python types, such as `int`, `str`, and `float`, developers can indicate the expected type of incoming data. Additionally, FastAPI leverages Python's type hints to automatically generate API documentation, making it easier for users to understand the API's structure. The `Optional` type, imported from the `typing` module, allows for defining parameters that can accept either a specified type or a `None` value. For instance, if a parameter is defined as `Optional[str]`, it means that the parameter can be a string or it can be omitted entirely. This flexibility is particularly useful for query parameters or request bodies, where not all data may be required for every request. By integrating typing and `Optional`, FastAPI provides strong data validation and a clear contract for API endpoints, resulting in more robust and maintainable applications.

 - Annotated :-

        In FastAPI, the concept of **Annotated** is derived from Python's typing system, specifically introduced in PEP 593. It allows developers to add additional metadata to function parameters using the `Annotated` type hint. This feature is particularly useful when you want to provide extra validation, constraints, or additional information regarding the parameters without altering their type. For example, when defining an API endpoint, you can use `Annotated` to specify both the type of a parameter and its constraints in a single statement. This enables clearer and more concise code while maintaining type safety and automatic data validation provided by FastAPI. By utilizing `Annotated`, developers can enhance their API endpoints with detailed descriptions, minimum and maximum values, regex patterns, or even custom validation functions, improving the overall usability and maintainability of the API. This powerful combination of typing and metadata leads to better documentation generation and error handling, ensuring that APIs are robust and user-friendly.
